A man was driving home late one afternoon, and he was driving 
above the speed limit.  He notices a police car with its red 
lights on in his rear view mirror.  

He thinks "I can outrun this guy," so he floors it and the race is 
on.  The cars are racing down the highway -- 60, 70, 80, 90 miles 
an hour. Finally, as his speedometer passes 100, the guy figures 
he can't outrun the cop and gives up.  He pulls over to the curb.
 
The police officer gets out of his cruiser and approaches the car. 
He leans down and says "Listen mister, I've had a really lousy day,
and I just want to go home.  Give me a good excuse and I'll let 
you go." 

The man thought for a moment and said, "Three weeks ago, my wife 
ran off with a police officer.  When I saw your cruiser in my rear 
view mirror, I thought you were that officer and you were trying 
to give her back to me!  
Modern Aesop's Fable

A horse and a chicken were walking down a country road and they 
saw that there was some corn just across the ditch by the road.  
The horse walked over to eat the corn.  Before he got to the corn 
he became stuck in the mud. For all his trying he could not get 
out of the mud.  

So he tells the chicken, "Hey, go over to that farm house and get 
some help to get me out of this mud."

When the chicken gets to the farm house, he can't find anybody to 
help him get the horse out of the mud.  However, he notices that 
there is a Mercedes parked in the driveway and the keys are in 
the ignition.  The chicken drives the Mercedes back down the road, 
ties a rope he found to the Mercedes and throws the other end to 
the horse.  In a jiffy the horse is out of the mud.
  
The two proceed down the road again.  And again they see some more 
corn on the side of the road.  This time the chicken crosses over 
the ditch to get the corn.  And as luck would have it, the chicken 
gets stuck in the mud.  

The chicken tells the horse, "Hey, go get that Mercedes and pull 
me out of this mud."  

The horse surveys the problem and says, "I think I can straddle 
this ditch because it is not too big and when I do just grab my 
dick and I'll pull you out of the mud."  The horse does as he says
and the chicken is pulled out of the mud.

So what is the moral of this story?

When your hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up 
chicks!]]
